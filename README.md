STA Coding Challenge â€“ Web Development Decisions
-------------------------------------------------

1)Technology Used:-
	C#,
	Selenium
	SpecLlow
	PageObjectModel
	GerkinLanguage to write the scenario

2)IDE Used to develop the code-Visualstudio professional 2022(we can use Visual studio free version too)

Instruction to load and run the project:-
------------------------------------------

1)Clone the repository in local

	https://github.com/bkannapi/TFL_CodingChallenge

2) Open the TFL_CodingChallenge folder from local and run TFL.sln file in visual studio

3)Go to Tools and Nugetpackagemanger in visulstudio and install dependencies
	SeleniumWebDriver
	SeleniumWaitHelpers
	SpecflowNunit
	ChromeDriver
	Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration
	Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Binder
	Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration_Json
	Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk
	NUnit
	NUnit3TestAdapter
	SpecFlow.Plus.LivingDocPlugin

4)Rebuild the code to auto install relevant dependencies if not alread

5) The URL not been hardcoded and read from the config file
	Support-Appsettings.Environments.json
	Configuration-EnvironmentConfig.cs
	ReadConfig.cs

6)NUnit Hooks been used
	Hooks will make sure chrome webdriver kept open for BeforeTestRun
	Hooks will make sure chrome webdriver closed AfterTestRun
	Multibrowesr run capability also been used in Hooks

7)Features Folder
	First three test scenarios been written in ValidJourney.Feature file since it's all involved a sequentiol flow of actions
	Verifyinvalidjourney.feature file is to test the invalid journey
	Verifynolocation.feature file is to test the no locations test scenario

8)Pages Folder
	Editpreferencespages.cs
	Validjourneypages.cs
These two class files been used across all stepdefinitions file to ensure code reusability and estabilisy page object model implementation

9)StepDefinitions Folder
	Validjourneystepdefinitions-Catre first three test scenarios
	verifyinvlidjourneystepdefinitions-Cater fourth scenario
	verifynolocationstepdefinitions-cater fifth scenario
Code reusability, page object model, webdriverwait so the releavnt action on the webelement will wait until ensure element load, assert statement for vefification and validation.

10)RUN the code
	Select Test-Test Explorer and select 'Run all tests in view'
you can see all five test run in sequence and PASS, expand the result in test explorer for review.
